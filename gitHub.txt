go to remote repo githug/gitignore

there we will find pre added gitignore for specific projects. These are templates and you can copy and use in your project

git commands:

1. set remote github 
	git remote add origin https://github.com/schethan60/test.git
		-In place of origin you can name it anything. But by convention use origin. Its the name of the remote

2. push your local to remote
	git push -u origin master
		- -u is flag to push, origin is remote name, master(default first branch) is name of the branch
			
3. git log - To view commit history.s
4. git diff filename.ext - To compare changes made in the file with its previous version.
5. git commit -m "Message in present tense" - to commit changes to local repository.

6a. git rm --cached -r . 
	- Remove(rm) all files (.) from the staging area recursively (-r)

6b. git restore --staged . - remove all files from staging area

7. git pull - pulls everything that was being pushed from remote to local repo. Basically deletes everything from the remote
8. git pull fileName.ext - pulls the file from remote to local repo and deletes the file from remote repo.

9. gitignore
	- create a file called .gitignore
	- add name of the files you don't to be staged
	- save

	Now these files that may contain your secret keys will never be staged and this makes sure that it won't be pushed to the remote repo by accident.

10. git clone url - to clone a repository to your working directory

11. git branches:
	a. git branch newBranchname - command to add new branch
	b. git branch - command to list available branches
	c. git checkout branchName - command to switch to other branch

12. e command: Before running this command switch to master/main branch
		git merge branchName - to merge to master branch.
