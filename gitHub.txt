Private: https://github.com/schethan60/private.git

git commands:

1. set remote github 
	git remote add origin https://github.com/schethan60/test.git
		-In place of origin you can name it anything. But by convention use origin. Its the name of the remote

2. push your local to remote
	git push -u origin master
		- -u is flag to push, origin is remote name, master(default first branch) is name of the branch
