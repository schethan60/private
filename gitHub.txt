git commands:

1. set remote github 
	git remote add origin https://github.com/schethan60/test.git

2. push your local to remote
	git push [-u origin master]
		- -u is flag to push, origin is remote name, master(default first branch) is name of the branch
			- for the first time include the square bracket one. Later, use only git push command
